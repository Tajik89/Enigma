# 🌟 Enigma Simulator 🌟

A comprehensive Python-based simulator of the historic **Enigma Machine**, used during **World War II**. This project demonstrates the fascinating mechanisms of encryption and decryption used by the Germans during the war, while providing an interactive way to explore and understand its functionality.

## ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Accurate Simulation**: Replicates the behavior of the original Enigma Machine, including rotors, plugboard, and reflector.
- 🖥️ **Interactive Interface**: Built to let users input messages and see how the encryption/decryption process works step by step.
- 📖 **Historical Context**: Includes detailed comments and documentation about the machine's significance during World War II.
- ⚙️ **Customizable Setup**: Configure rotors, reflector types, plugboard connections, and initial rotor positions.
- 🎓 **Educational Value**: Ideal for learning cryptography basics and the history of codebreaking.

## 🛠️ Installation

### 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive usage)

### 🚀 Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tajik89/Enigma.git
   cd Enigma
   ```
2. Run the simulator in Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook TAKING_Enigma.ipynb
   ```

## 🔍 How It Works

The Enigma Machine encrypts messages by passing each character through a series of **rotors**, a **plugboard**, and a **reflector**. This simulator accurately mimics these steps:

1. 🔄 **Plugboard (Steckerbrett)**: Swaps pairs of letters.
2. ⚙️ **Rotors**: Shift letters according to a substitution cipher that changes with each keypress.
3. 🪞 **Reflector**: Reflects the signal back through the rotors, ensuring the process is symmetric.
4. 🔓 **Decryption**: Simply re-enter the encrypted message with the same settings to decrypt it.

## 📜 Background

The **Enigma Machine** was a cipher device used by Nazi Germany for secure military communication. Breaking its encryption, most notably by Polish and British cryptanalysts, was a pivotal factor in the Allied victory during World War II.

This project honors the remarkable achievements of those who contributed to breaking Enigma, including **Alan Turing** and his team at Bletchley Park.
